The Memory Mixer 

Aakanksha Aggarwal 

My project is an artistic representation of the way memories are formed, how they evolve, fragment and ultimately decay. I am interested in using code to create interesting patterns and generative art. I am inspired by how minimal code can create such beautiful experiences.

Use of code:
ofxSerial to connect Arduino to openFrameworks
ofxGui to display parameters onscreen for easy control
Shaders in the GLSL language to manipulate all the pixels simultaneously
